<p><h3>Hello, let me start off by briefly presenting myself,</h3></p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>[~]$ whoami</p>
    <p>My name is Nicolas Rabergeau, I am 19 years old and I’m currently on my first-year learning networking and telecommunications at the University of Belfort-Montbeliard</p>

    <p>I was born an only child in a small town called Merced in the state of California as you see it is located really in the centre of California. This is where I grew up and where my childhood took place.</p>
    <p>I then moved to a town called Vallejo where I made some of the best friends in my life who are still friends with me till this day and discovered a completely new neighbourhood with a new school.</p>
    <p>I finally moved to the well-known city of San Francisco because of a job opportunity my dad had this is where I went to elementary school and really got to experience what it’s like to live a big city for the first time.</p>

    <p>When I finished elementary school, my parents decided that we should settle down in France. This is where I did middle school and high school which is equivalent to college and lycée.</p>
    <p>Being an only child and constantly changing to different schools I never settled in anywhere I was always on the move. So, having such a unique experience compared to others it was hard for me to fit in in school in France. While all my colleges at school were having fun fitting and relating to one another, I was there being the introvert not talking, but it was because of this that I gained a desire to computers, because when you are on a computer you don’t need to worry about how you look and how well you can talk in public. On a computer you are simply a username with a maybe a profile picture, you have the possibility to be whoever you want to be. </p>
